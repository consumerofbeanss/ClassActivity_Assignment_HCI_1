## Let's first implement a sign up modal box in jQuery!

### Instructions
As you can see in the Expected Result window, the modal should appear when the green Sign up with Email button is pressed, and disappear when the close-button in the right-top is pressed.

### Notes
Be attentive to the fact that there are two sign up buttons (the Sign up with Email button and the "Start Learning" button).

### Important Points
1. Do not remove or change the class or id names in index.html.
2. When adding the new classes and ids, use the names provided below.
3. Set the class as shown below.
- Signup button: **signup-show**
4. Set the id for the elements as shown below.
- The entire modal: **signup-modal** 
- Closing button: **close-modal**
